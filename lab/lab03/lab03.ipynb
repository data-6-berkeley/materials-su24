In this lab, you'll learn several important table methods for producing data visualizations. **Visualizations** are some of the most powerful tools in data science; they're helpful for showing data to people who don't necessarily have a background in data science, and allow data scientists like yourselves to help others understand the data in a more intuitive way.\n",

The remaining optional arguments in the `datascience` documentation linked above can also be used, feel free to try out some of the others on your own!\n",
